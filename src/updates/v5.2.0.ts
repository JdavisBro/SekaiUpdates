- A new furniture called [Block] will be added to MySekai. Blocks can be crafted and placed to decorate your SEKAI.
- Blocks are stackable and you can place small furniture on top of them.
- There will be 2 types of blocks, [colored] and [clear]. There will be 20 different colored blocks and 1 clear block.
- [Colored Blocks], as the name suggests, are solid colored blocks, while [Clear Blocks] are colorless/transparent blocks. Players and characters can pass through [Clear Blocks].

## Notes

- There may be height/stack difference for each furniture that can be placed on top of the blocks depending on the furniture's size.
- Some furniture has specific position that will trigger character's reaction, so there may be chances that characters won't be able to react/interact with some furniture when placed on top of a block.`,

- Compensation Memoria will also be sent to players who have leveled up their gates (Amount will be based on each unit's gate level and the amount of Memoria you have used before the update)
